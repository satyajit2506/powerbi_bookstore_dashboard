📘 Power BI Bookstore Dashboard

This project is a 3-page interactive Power BI dashboard built using bookstore data containing Books, Customers, and Orders.
The goal of the dashboard is to understand book sales, customer behaviour, revenue insights, and order patterns.

📁 Dataset Used

I used three CSV/Excel files:

1️⃣ Books.csv

book_id

title

author

genre

price

stock

2️⃣ Customers.csv

customer_id

customer_name

city

country

3️⃣ Orders.csv

order_id

book_id

customer_id

order_date

quantity

🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
✔ Removed blanks & duplicate rows

Ensured the dataset was clean before loading into Power BI.

✔ Date formatting

Converted the order_date column into proper Date format so it can be used for:

time-series charts

sorting

date filters

✔ Created relationships

Books ↔ Orders (book_id)

Customers ↔ Orders (customer_id)

🧮 DAX Measures Used

I calculated important measures using DAX:

✔ Total Amount
Total Amount = SUM(Orders[Quantity] * RELATED(Books[Price]))

✔ Average Order Value (AOV)
AOV = AVERAGE(Orders[Total Amount])

✔ Top N calculations

Used Top N filters to find:

Top Books by revenue

Top Customers

Top Cities & Countries

📊 Dashboard Pages
📘 1. Book Details

Top books by revenue

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 2. Customer Details
